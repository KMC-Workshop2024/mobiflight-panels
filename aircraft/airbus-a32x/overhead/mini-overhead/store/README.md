# Airbus Mini Overhead Setup

1. Download the .mcc file from here: https://github.com/MobiFlight/mobiflight-panels/tree/main/aircraft/airbus-a32x/overhead/mini-overhead/store (click on the file and at the top right corner then click the downwards pointing arrow going into a tray labelled 'download raw file' when hovered over with your mouse).

2.	Open the .mcc from within MobiFlight taking care not to skip the next step

3.	The most important part is when you get this message, select your mini overhead from the drop down box, click on the Orphaned Serial to make it blue, then click assign
